# Beemo

Manage build tools, their configuration, and commands in a single centralized repository. Beemo aims
to solve the multi-project maintenance fatigue by removing the following burdens across all
projects: config and dotfile management, multiple config patterns, up-to-date development
dependencies, continuous copy and paste, and more.

### Features

* Manage build tools and configurations in a single repository.
* Configure supported build tools using `.js` files.
* Customize and alter config at runtime with CLI options.
* Pass custom CLI options to build tool commands without failure.
* Automatically expand glob patterns (a better alternative to bash).
* Easily share config between build tools.
* Avoid relative config or `extend` paths.
* Automatic config file cleanup.
* Custom scripts with CLI options.
* Dotfile synchronization.
* And much more.
